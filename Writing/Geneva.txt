		---Geneva---

A glistening lake outside Geneva,
quicksilver covers the sand.
Gazing out at the tide,
drenched in the ignorance of war.
“Well, its tough, you know, is international law.
So just be glad we didn’t need more.”

“Less is death, and life is more.”
“We need her.”
Onto the water, a petal, a gavel, a law.
Turning their backs to the sand,
two partners in war.
Buried, their feet and hands tied.

The bodies bloated, victims of a spring tide,
water over their heads no more.
Brittle skulls filled with skeletons of war,
ninety years from Geneva.
The future falls on Mediterranean sand,
and dies under European law.

Above all men, such lore.
“Aye, but depends on the height of the tide,
and the breadth of the sand.”
Get lucky, yes, that’s something more,
but otherwise you’ll need her.
For there’s no hope in this war.

Back home, they say, “What war?”
“What law?”
Or is that what they do in Geneva?
Marble towers stand out from the tide,
but their lighthouses shine no more,
beneath them only black sand.

Rivers and sand,
that map of war.
No more,
no law,
for the tide,
has taken Geneva.

Along that strip of sand, raged the war,
the law, proved no more,
like a tide sweeping over Geneva.
