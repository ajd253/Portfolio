	---Scarred Land---

Black feet stand firm beneath the big sky.
The sun slides through the trees.
Its light softens the blackened hills,
Over which they pray.

Upon the prairie, needles have sewn,
Asphalt and coffins,
For men who speak of minutes,
And keeping their peace.

Proud on the range, an old cÂ¬hurch stands,
Hewn of stone by wind and rain,
Its spire broken by men,
And stolen in pain.
