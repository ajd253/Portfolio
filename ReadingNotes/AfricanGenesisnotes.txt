AFRICAN GENESIS

				    ---1: The New Enlightenment---

Territoriality is innate and as powerful as sex.
Evidence for birds competing over territory not sex. 					
	Territory was the precursor to sex.
	#Similar to modern sexual appeal - not just attraction but wealth and power>
Universal "primary passion for a place of one's own." 					

#How will climate change impact species' territorial competition?

Territorial defence relies upon social order. 			
Social order relies upon dominance hierarchy.
Social order supported by outsider.

Female = sexual specialist; male = territorial specialist.

"hinge of the African continent"
#What about more recent findings? eg Jebel Irhoud

Science previously convinced that:
	man emerged in Asia.
	was not carnivorous at emergence.
	developed a large brain after other adaptations.

>Aggression is thus integral as weapons gave man's ancestors the upper hand.
Weapons demanded neural development.



>Is human evolution and thus human history driven by the development of weapons?

Society is the work of man || man is the work of society.

#Society defines territory through societal norms.
#Societies move from land-based territory > to material territory > to immaterial territory.
	#Ideology/intellectual territory = the drive for knowledge.
	#Cultural territory = the drive for influence/standing.
	#Political territory = the drive for power.

			  ---2: One Tiger to a Hill---

Individual territory is necessary because it ensures:
	sufficient security for reproduction.
	species' surplus members are cast off.

eg lion pride maintains exclusive hunting territory.

>The drive to possess is inherent, not instrumental.

Male birdsong marks territory.
Male birds defend territory ferociously.


			 ---3:The Society of Animals---

>Primates are generalists. Without the anatomy to fight human ancestors required weapons.

Flattid bugs.

>Instincts are the most base of behaviours. Primitive animals are governed only by instinct.
>Human have weak instincts. Instead they must learn skills.
>Weak instincts permit extensive learning.



Primates are defined by a lack of specialisation.
Primates not dependent on seasonal sexuality - menstrual cycles instead of heat seasons.

>Four factors:
> 	sex.
> 	territory.
> 	large brain.
> 	vulnerable body.
>All have contributed to the evolution of primates' complex societies.
>And in humans, a fifth factor:
> 	predation.

Year-round sexual opportunity contributes to development of permanent families.
Differences between primates.
#Gorilla's take a harem - links to Middle Eastern/African polygamy?
Size of a primate male's harem may not be solely up to him. There may be female decision in play.

>Young primates mature slowly (at roughly the same rate as human children).
>Primates are born with poor instincts and must instead learn from experience.
#Balance between experience and instinct.

Otter's instincts vs baboon's blunders.
#Importance of meaning in experience. Experience is the construction/derivation of meaning from reality.

>Need for primate learning and maturation gave rise to families.
